# Etheralt-Modpack
A modded Minecraft modpack.
Currently rather kitchen sink, set on 1.12 with many of the major mods. Endgame (other than creative fun!) centered around Project E addons and Advanced Rocketry.
Progression is setup to require the player to try out a variety of mods, and uses Reskilable to lightly gate content. Because of this, combat and other forms of experience-gathering are required.
Players are given a modpack guide and a syringe with a special power upon joining the world, and will find themselves in a universe of magic and technology where even the stars are reachable.
